      DIRECTIONS: Let's discuss some of our favorite things!

      1. Create the h2 tag "Favorite Foods."
      2. Create an unordered list of at least three of your favorite foods.
      3. Make an h2 header for "Favorite Animals."
      4. Make an ordered list of at least three of your favorite animals.
      5. Make an h3 header for "Cute Animals."
      6. Are you a cat or a dog person? Why not both? Make a paragraph tag containing the text, "It's raining cats and dogs!"
      7. Make an image tag with the alt attribute set to "Dog Picture" and the src attribute set to "http://place-puppy.com/200x200"
      8. Make an image tag with the alt attribute set to "Cat Picture" and the src attribute set to "http://placekitten.com/200/200"
      9. Don't forget to give credit! Let's make a link tag (<a>) that credits placekitten. The href attribute should be set to the website address "http://placekitten.com" and the link text (between the opening and closing tags) should be "Place Kitten."
      10. Repeat step 9 for place-puppy.
      11. Wrap your two links from steps 9 and 10 in a paragraph (<p>) tag to place them on their own line.

      BONUS:
      - The numbers on the placeholder links represent the image size in pixels. Try changing the numbers to see different images of cats and dogs in various sizes.
      - Explore a little! There are tons of image placeholder sitesâ€”not just for cats and dogs, but for many different interests. Find one that you really like and put an example in.

        Directions:
          1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content.
          2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
          3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
          4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
          5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")
          6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
          7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
          8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
          9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/
  
          BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
            - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
            - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).
